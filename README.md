# Concerts in Toronto Web App

## Project Overview

This is my first Chrome Extension Made:

The "Concerts in Toronto" web app is a simple, user-friendly interface designed to showcase upcoming concerts in Toronto. 
It features a minimalistic design with a focus on usability and aesthetics. The app displays one event at a time with navigation buttons to cycle through different events.


Uses a Concert API from Rapid API that shows all the concert data in a certain time line.
